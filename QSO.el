;; This code defines the function `add-qso` function which prompts the user for information about a new amateur radio contact and adds it to a text file called `radio-log.txt` in the user's home directory and to an ADIF file `radio-logbook.adi`.

;; To use this functions, you would first invoke `add-qso` to add one or more entries to the logbook, and then import the resulting ADIF file to import the logbook into another logging program or platform that supports the ADIF format for further processing.
