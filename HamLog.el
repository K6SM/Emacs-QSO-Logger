;; This code defines two functions: `add-log-entry` and `export-logbook-adif`. The `add-log-entry` function prompts the user for information about a new amateur radio contact and adds it to a text file called `radio-log.txt` in the user's home directory. The `export-logbook-adif` function reads the contents of `radio-log.txt` and converts it to ADIF format, writing the result to a file called `radio-logbook.adi`.

;; To use these functions, you would first invoke `add-log-entry` to add one or more entries to the logbook, and then invoke `export-logbook-adif` to export the logbook to ADIF format. You can then use the resulting ADIF file to import the logbook into another logging program or platform that supports the ADIF format.
