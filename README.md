# Emacs-QSO-Logger
This code provides some basic Emacs functions to capture and log amateur radio contacts (QSOs).
This provides a very simple way of rapidly logging QSOs with Emacs. The LISP code can be customized as needed to include additional ADIF fields for contesting or other purposes. Further processing of the logs can be done within Emacs or by importing the ADIF file into another logging program.
