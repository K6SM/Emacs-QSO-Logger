# Emacs-QSO-Logger
This code defines functions to capture amateur radio contacts (QSOs) and them to a text file and to an ADIF file in the user's home directory.
This provides a very simple way of rapidly logging QSOs with Emacs. The code can be easily expanded as needed to include additional ADIF fields for contesting or other purposes. Further processing of the log can be done within Emacs or by importing the resulting ADIF file into another logging program.
