# Emacs-QSO-Logger
This code defines Emacs functions to capture amateur radio contacts (QSOs) and append them to a text file and to an ADIF file in the user's home directory.
This provides a very simple way of rapidly logging QSOs with Emacs. The LISP code can be customized as needed to include additional ADIF fields for contesting or other purposes. Further processing of the logs can be done within Emacs or by importing the ADIF file into another logging program.
